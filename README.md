# OxideKV

This is a pet project I am be working on to learn about Distributed Systems in Go. 

This a Distributed Key Value Store with an underlying engine such as RocksDB or BadgerDB (I still have to decide).

I will be implementing the Raft Consensus Algorithm.

This project will be my main focus after I have covered the basics of Go through [PrintPQ](https://github.com/shariqnaiyer/printPQ)
